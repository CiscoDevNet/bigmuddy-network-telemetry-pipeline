# How to build?
#
# docker build -f ./Kuberfile -t pipeline:<version> .
#
# Assumes the fully configured configurations will be supplied
# in Kubernetes as a ConfigMap to /data/config
# pipeline is placed in / (root) but workdir is set to /data volume
# in order to allow the create/delete of other files like models.txt
# which is otherwise not allowed by platforms such as OpenShift
# where there are security restrictions by default on permissions.
