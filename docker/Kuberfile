#
# docker build -f ./Kuberfile -t pipeline:<version> .
#
# Assumes the fully configured configurations will be supplied
# in Kubernetes as a ConfigMap to /data/config
# pipeline is now placed in /data in order to allow the create/delete
# of other files which is otherwise not allowed by platforms such as
# OpenShift where there are security implications.
